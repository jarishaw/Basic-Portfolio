			<p class="info"> I have been a logistics analyst in the supply chain organization at a large technology company for roughly seven years. Through new company initiatives, I was encouraged to expand and develop new skills and was given access to a body of tutorials on countless number of topics. I’m sure the expectation was to build upon current or acquire new skillsets within the same field but I went a completely different route. MySQL was the first tutorial I chose. Next, I randomly chose Java as my next course. Although the courses were tough, I liked them so much that I made the decision to acquire the skills necessary to become a web developer. I’ve always enjoyed learning something new. With web development, things often change, so there is always an opportunity to learn. And being able to produce great work is just an added bonus.</p>

			<p class="info">Apart from that, I am a bit of a gym rat. Yes, unlike a lot of people, I genuinely enjoy it. But I enjoy food even more. My philosophy is to work out hard so I can eat just about whatever I want. I have a love for all things zombie (The Walking Dead), sci-fi/fantasy (The LOTR and Hobbit movies never get old, no matter how many times I’ve seen them), traveling/hiking and I fall asleep watching Zootopia every night.</p>

			<p class="info">When I finish bootcamp, I’m going to Disneyworld!! Seriously, Pandora-The World of Avatar looks awesome!!</p>
